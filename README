My notSoBasic Arduino

These are the first assighnments that I did in quarter 1 year 1 at CHS.
They are the codes to the first couple assighnments I did.
The Hello functions assignment is one of the assignments I did. I had to power a sensor with code.
Also I had to wire it and make it tell me the distance of an object that is in the range of it.
The NewPing() assignment is another assignment that I finished.
The assignment was to make something cool but basic.
Either turning on or off an LED.
Or powering a sensor. Either way is fine.
