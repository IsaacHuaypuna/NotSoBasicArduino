# HelloFunctions


## Description:
HelloFunctions was my first assignment in Engineering.The assignment is about trying to make a sensor work and tell the distance between the sensor and the object infront of it. The way the sensor will tell you the distance is by using the Serial monitor. Not just that but once the sensor finds the distance of an object it will move a servo for whatever the distance was of the object. Range of the sensor is pretty short though. The srevo also moves up to a 180 instead of a 360.
