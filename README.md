# HelloFunctions


## Description:
HelloFunctions was my first assignment in Engineering.The assignment is about trying to make a sensor work and tell the distance between the sensor and the object infront of it. The way the sensor will tell you the distance is by using the Serial monitor. Not just that but once the sensor finds the distance of an object it will move a servo for whatever the distance was of the object. Range of the sensor is pretty short though. The srevo also moves up to a 180 instead of a 360.

## Lessons:
Google is and will forever be my friend
the people around me can help me with my assignment.
Wiring is something harder than I thought and requires more pratice.


# NewPing() 

## Description:
This was my second assignment in Engineering class. NewPing() is an assignment that is like a "free for all." The assignment is
make something cool but simple. Like turning on and off a couple of LEDs in a pattern or at the same time or do something with the sensor. What I did though was an something of both LED and ultrasonic sensor. My sensor would do what a sensor does best and dectect an item and if it dectects an item it will turn on an LED.

## Lessons:
 Sensors can do a lot more than what I originally thought.
 Sensors are more complicated than i thought.
 Asking isn't a tool of cowards its a tool of trying.
