My notSoBasic Arduino

These are the first assighnments that I did in quarter 1 year 1 at CHS.
They are the codes to the first couple assighnments I did.

HelloFunctions is one of my engineering assignments where I have to find or make a code that will turn on
 a sensor which will tell me the distance of an object.

The NewPing() assignment is where I have to do something basic but cool like turning on and off an LED or
using a sensor or something like that.
